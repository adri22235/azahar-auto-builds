## 🏗️ About This Repository
This repository documents the **automated build process** for the Azahar Emulator. It serves as the technical evidence for the **Milestone 2125** stable release, focusing on high-performance compilation and artifact management.

Unlike standard builds, this workflow uses **AI-assisted optimization** to manage dependency trees and reduce compile times significantly.
